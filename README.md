# JOPA Examples

This repository contains some usage examples of the [JOPA framework](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jopa) - a persistence library
for Semantic Web data (both RDF and OWL).

### Examples

1. **Example01** - JOPA with a RDF4J in-memory storage, working with object model generated by OWL2Java.
2. **Example02** - JOPA using OWLAPI-accessed files as storage.
3. **Example03** - JOPA with a native RDF4J storage utilizing its contexts to store and access data in different RDF named graphs.
4. **Example04** - Full-blown Java web application with Spring, REST services, ReactJS-based UI and JOPA with RDF4J native storage. 
Declarative transactions included. Lombok is used to generate boilerplate entity code.
5. **Example05** - JOPA utilizing [OWL2Query](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/portal/owl2query) - a SPARQL-DL query engine for OWLAPI.
6. **eswc2016** - JOPA demo for the ESWC 2016 conference. A running version can be found at 
[http://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/jopa-eswc-demo/](http://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/jopa-eswc-demo/).
7. **Example06** - JOPA showcasing support for mapped superclasses and plain identifier object property values.
8. **JOPA JSON-LD** - JOPA with [JB4JSON-LD](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jb4jsonld) for Jackson and Spring - 
serialization/deserialization of POJOs into/from JSON-LD. Also, showcases declarative transaction support for JOPA and Spring.
9. **Example07** - JOPA demonstrating support for single inheritance and plural data properties.
10. **Example08** - JOPA using the Jena OntoDriver and demonstrating support for polymorphism in the object model. 
It is a Spring Boot application, uses declarative transactions and JSON-LD.
11. **Example09** - JOPA with the [Semantic Object Query Language](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jopa/wiki/Semantic-Object-Query-Language)
 support. It is a Spring Boot application, uses autowiring of JOPA `EntityManager`, and produces JSON-LD.
12. **Example10** - Treatment of strings and languages in JOPA. This example also contains a sample Gradle build configuration.

Each example has its own README file with a more detailed description.

#### Additional Examples

Several publicly available applications use JOPA, so if you are interested in a more complex showcase of the library, check
out one of the following:

##### Reporting Tool

Reporting Tool is a safety occurrence reporting and investigation tool used for a project in the aviation safety domain.

Its source code can be found at [https://github.com/kbss-cvut/reporting-tool](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/reporting-tool).

_Note that the project is no longer actively developed and maintained._

##### TermIt

TermIt is a Spring Boot-based web application. It uses declarative transactions, heavily relies on repository contexts, and its 
REST services consume/produce JSON-LD. JOPA is used as the persistence provider.

It is the most complex JOPA-based application developed by us to-date.

### Requirements

All the examples are written in Java and built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (Example10 also supports [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)). 
To run them, the following is required:

- Java 11 or later
- Apache Maven 3.x
